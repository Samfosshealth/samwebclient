                        less-abled individuals be any different? We believe, they shouldn't. At SAMFOS HEALTH we provide one 
                        on-one companionship and care in the comfort and security of your own home. Completely bespoke to you, we
                        match our carers to your individual needs and personality, likes and dislikes. 
                        Maintaining independence, learning new skills and simply enjoying life is often taken for granted until it is taken 
                        away from us, but there is no reason our lives and well being has to change as our circumstances do. Everyone needs 
                        peace of mind that there future care or the care of a loved one is in the best hands possible.

                        <p data-equal-group="2">Elderly people take more medications than other age groups, they benefit the most from them, and can lead to a higher risk of health if they do not take them properly. Unfortunately, older adults are at risk for non adherence to their medicine prescriptions for many reasons including:<br><br>
•	Vision problems - they have difficulty reading the prescription or dosage instructions<br>
•	Hearing problems - they misunderstand or cannot hear doctors' and pharmacists' instructions.<br>
•	Cognitive impairments - they may not understand that they are supposed to take medications or memory loss causes them to forget to do so.<br>
•	Arthritis or lack of muscle strength - they may have difficulty opening medicine packaging.<br>
•	They have trouble swallowing<br>
•	Mobility issues - they cannot get to their medication or pick up prescriptions from the pharmacy.<br>
•	Chronic conditions such as high blood pressure or osteoporosis with no symptoms - without cues, they can lose the motivation or forget to take medication.<br>
•	Multiple medications - they become overwhelmed trying to manage the timing and dosage amounts.<br><br>
Our carers are trained to work with service users specific  medication profiles (which may change regularly) and ensure that all medicines are taken on time and in accordance with their prescription.
No matter our age, a little help with our medication can sometimes save a life time of problems

                        <p data-equal-group="3"><strong>Respite care</strong> is the provision of short-term, temporary relief to those who are caring for family members who might otherwise require permanent placement in a facility outside the home, such as a Residential Home or a Nursing Home. Respite also provides a positive experience for the person receiving care. Even though many families take great joy in providing care to their loved ones so that they can remain at home, the physical, emotional and financial consequences for the caregiver can be very overwhelming without some support.<br><br>
                       <strong>SAMFOS HEALTH</strong> recognises that it is not only the service user that requires assistance, you as the primary care giver needs to take a break every now and again. Whether it is just for an afternoon or a couple of weeks, we are here to give you the peace of mind that your loved one is being cared for while you catch up with those things you have been putting off or to simply enjoy a well deserved rest/holiday.<br><br> 
                       We understand that you want the care your relative receives to be of the same high standard as what you in fact provide yourself. Our staff will work with you and your family to come out with an individualised care plan suitable to the needs of your loved one. Home care is popular for obvious reasons.

                        <p> The temporary carer comes to the regular Service user’s home, and gets to know the individual in his or her normal environment (with the familypresent in the initial stages). The temporary carer learns the family routine, where medicines are stored, the normal daily routine etc,  and the service user is not inconvenienced by transportation and strange environments.
